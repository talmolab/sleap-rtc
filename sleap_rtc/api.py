"""High-level Python API for sleap-rtc GUI integration.

This module provides a clean, synchronous API for SLEAP GUI to interact with
sleap-rtc functionality. It wraps the lower-level CLI and client functionality
into simple function calls.

Example usage:
    >>> import sleap_rtc.api as rtc
    >>> if rtc.is_available() and rtc.is_logged_in():
    ...     rooms = rtc.list_rooms()
    ...     workers = rtc.list_workers(rooms[0].id)

            with (attempted_path, error_message, send_fn). ``send_fn`` is

            ``RemoteFileBrowser.on_response()`` for interactive file browsing
            during path resolution dialogs.

            missing video paths. Called with (videos, send_fn) where
            ``videos`` is a list of ``VideoPathStatus`` objects and
            ``send_fn`` is a thread-safe wrapper around the data channel's
            send method. The callback should return a dict mapping
            ``{original_path: resolved_worker_path}`` or None to cancel.
            Called while the data channel is alive so ``send_fn`` can be
            used for remote file browsing.

    """Run training remotely on a worker.

    Submits a training job to a worker in the specified room and waits
    for completion. Progress events are forwarded to the callback if provided.

    There are two ways to provide the training config:
    1. ``config_path``: Path to a config YAML file on the shared filesystem.
    2. ``config_content``: Serialized config YAML string sent over datachannel.
    3. ``spec``: A pre-built TrainJobSpec (overrides all other spec parameters).

    Args:
        config_path: Path to training config YAML file (on worker filesystem).
        room_id: The room ID containing the worker.
        worker_id: Specific worker ID. If None, auto-selects best available.
        labels_path: Override for data_config.train_labels_path.
        val_labels_path: Override for data_config.val_labels_path.
        max_epochs: Override max training epochs.
        batch_size: Override batch size.
        learning_rate: Override learning rate.
        run_name: Name for the training run/checkpoint directory.
        resume_ckpt_path: Path to checkpoint to resume from.
        progress_callback: Function called with ProgressEvent for each update.
        timeout: Maximum time to wait for job completion in seconds.
        config_content: Serialized training config (YAML string) sent over
            datachannel. Alternative to config_path for GUI integration.
        path_mappings: Maps original client-side paths to resolved worker paths.
        spec: A pre-built TrainJobSpec. When provided, config_path,
            config_content, labels_path, and other spec fields are ignored.
        model_type: Model type string for LossViewer filtering (e.g.,
            "centroid", "centered_instance"). Included in all ProgressEvent
            objects emitted to the progress_callback.
        on_log: Optional callback invoked with each raw log line from the
            worker that doesn't match a known protocol prefix. Use this to
            display live training output in a terminal or text widget.
        on_channel_ready: Optional callback invoked with a thread-safe send
            function once the data channel is open. Use this to enable
            bidirectional communication (e.g., sending stop/cancel commands
            to the worker during training).
        on_raw_progress: Optional callback invoked with the raw jsonpickle
            payload string from ``PROGRESS_REPORT::`` messages. Used to
            forward sleap-nn's native ZMQ progress directly to LossViewer.
        on_model_type: Optional callback invoked when the worker sends a
            ``MODEL_TYPE::`` message indicating a switch between models
            in multi-model pipeline training.
        on_inference_message: Optional callback invoked with ``(msg_type,
            data)`` for post-training inference messages sent by the worker
            after training completes.  ``msg_type`` is one of
            ``"INFERENCE_BEGIN"``, ``"INFERENCE_PROGRESS"``,
            ``"INFERENCE_COMPLETE"``, ``"INFERENCE_FAILED"``,
            ``"INFERENCE_SKIPPED"``.  When provided, the data channel stays
            open after the last ``JOB_COMPLETE`` until a terminal inference
            message is received.

    Returns:
        TrainingResult with job outcome and model paths.

    Raises:
        AuthenticationError: If user is not logged in.
        RoomNotFoundError: If room does not exist or has no workers.
        ConfigurationError: If config is invalid.
        JobError: If the training job fails.

    Submits an inference job to a worker in the specified room and waits

    Args:
        data_path: Path to data file (SLP or video) on worker filesystem.
        model_paths: List of model directory paths on worker filesystem.
        room_id: The room ID containing the worker.
        worker_id: Specific worker ID. If None, auto-selects best available.
        output_path: Output predictions file path on worker.
        batch_size: Inference batch size.
        peak_threshold: Peak detection threshold.
        only_suggested_frames: Only run on suggested frames.
        frames: Frame range string (e.g., "0-100,200-300").
        progress_callback: Function called with progress updates.
        timeout: Maximum time to wait for job completion in seconds.
        on_channel_ready: Optional callback invoked once with a thread-safe
            ``send_fn(str)`` after the data channel is authenticated. The
            GUI's Cancel button uses this to send ``MSG_JOB_CANCEL`` from
            the Qt thread without touching the asyncio loop directly.
        on_log: Optional callback invoked with raw log lines from the
            worker (Task 9 wiring; accepted in Task 8 for forward
            compatibility).
        on_job_message: Optional callback invoked with ``(msg_type, payload)``
            for typed ``JOB_*`` dispatches (Task 9 wiring; accepted in
            Task 8 for forward compatibility).

    Returns:
        InferenceResult with job outcome and predictions path.

    Raises:
        AuthenticationError: If user is not logged in.
        RoomNotFoundError: If room does not exist or has no workers.
        ConfigurationError: If job spec is invalid.
